note3D PUZZLE GAME DEVELOPEMNT TIMELINE
Total Duration: 6–7 Weeks



Target Platforms: Android & iOS
Engine: Unity (C#)



✅ Milestone 1: Core Prototype (with Real Assets)
Duration: 2 Weeks Cost: $100
🎯 Goals:
1. Asset Integration
o Integrate actual 3D assets for conveyors, machines, and resources provided by Client✅
o Ensure correct alignment, scaling, and visual consistency from the beginning.✅
2. Conveyor Placement System o Drag-and-drop placement with real models. o Support rotation (up/down/left/right).✅
o UI to select and place conveyors from the inventory.✅
3. Real-Time Resource Flow o Implement resource movement using the actual visual assets.✅
o Resources move along conveyors from Point A to Point B.✅
4. Transformation Machine (Basic) o Use real transformation machine model. o Convert resources (e.g., IRON → IRON BAR) and continue the flow.✅
5. Time-Based Failure Condition o Lose condition only if the time runs out before delivering required items.✅
6. Basic UI o Play/Pause/Reset buttons.✅
o Display level number, timer, remaining conveyors.✅
7. Test Level o Build 1 prototype level using real assets to validate core mechanics.✅



✅ Milestone 2: Core Gameplay Systems
Duration: 2–3 Weeks
Cost: $200
🎯 Goals:
1. Multi-Step Transformation o Extend transformation flow (e.g., IRON → IRON BAR → FINAL PRODUCT). o Add more transformation machines.✅
2. Resource Management✅
o Configure production rates, resource limits.❌ ⁉️  ( Not Needed)
o Destroy/loss condition if items don't reach the target in time.✅
3. Game Objectives & Logic o Add specific delivery goals per level (e.g., deliver 10 Iron Bars).✅
o Track success/failure based on real-time delivery and time.✅
4. Level Design o Manually design 5–10 progressively difficult levels.✅
o Introduce obstacles❌, limited conveyor count✅, and new mechanics✅.
5. Save/Load System o Save player progress✅, stars earned✅ (if implemented).✅
o Load saved progress at startup.✅
6. (Optional) Star Rating System o Rate level performance (1–3 stars) based on time and accuracy. o Display results at level completion.✅



✅ Milestone 3: Polish & UX Enhancements
Duration: 1 Week
Cost: $50
🎯 Goals:
1. Animations o Conveyor movement, machine operations, transformation visuals.✅
o Smooth, appealing animations with mobile optimization.✅
2. UI Enhancements✅
o Improve the clarity and aesthetics of all buttons, HUD, and level display. ✅
o Optimize touch responsiveness and layout for mobile. ✅
3. Sound & Music o Add appropriate SFX for conveyor motion, transformations, and UI.✅
o Integrate light industrial background music.✅
4. Mobile UX Tuning o Refine touch drag/drop mechanics. o Improve gestures and responsiveness for smaller screens.✅



NEW THINGs NEEDED BY CLIENT:	
\- I think it's better to start down to go up and not up to go down✅
\- the conveyors have to be always the same length⁉️ and width in all part because in the long term, they have to fit to be juicy, and if possible the iron bar, etc, doesn't jump.✅
\- it's a good idea the conveyor the jump but in the idea, we have conveyor to go up and down to have puzzle very difficult, i will show you an image ✅
\-
Maybe you right it's better to jump and no going up and down, on the phone it's going to be difficult, but maybe not a conveyor to jump but like a bump thing ? 
ANSWER:	{ Its a Very Good approach of using Jumper/Bumper for the material jump }

{ NEW OUT OF SCOPE REQUIREMENT }
\- And have you an asset of a train in you're Unity ? because, the finish of the level would be you put iron bar in a train and when you finish, you see the train going to the another level and after and after✅, 

\- To be more juicy, and put more iron bar in the game✅, to see lot of things going in the point A after point B etc  










✅ Milestone 4: Finalization & Release Prep
Duration: 1 Week
Cost: $60
🎯 Goals:
1. Interactive Tutorial o Teach players how to place conveyors, rotate, and complete transformations step-by-step.
2. Final Level Polish o Refine and finalize all levels (15–20 total).
o Add challenging layouts and last-stage mechanics.
3. Optimization o Memory and performance tuning.
o Ensure smooth performance on target devices.
4. QA & Bug Fixing
o Full testing cycle: fix logical, visual, and control-related issues.
o Validate save/load system works on all levels.
5. App Store Submission o Prepare store materials (icon, screenshots, metadata). o Submit the build for review on App Store & Google Play.
