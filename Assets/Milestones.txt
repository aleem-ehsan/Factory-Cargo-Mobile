note3D PUZZLE GAME DEVELOPEMNT TIMELINE
Total Duration: 6–7 Weeks



Target Platforms: Android & iOS
Engine: Unity (C#)



✅ Milestone 1: Core Prototype (with Real Assets)
Duration: 2 Weeks Cost: $100
🎯 Goals:
1. Asset Integration
o Integrate actual 3D assets for conveyors, machines, and resources provided by Client✅
o Ensure correct alignment, scaling, and visual consistency from the beginning.✅
2. Conveyor Placement System o Drag-and-drop placement with real models. o Support rotation (up/down/left/right).✅
o UI to select and place conveyors from the inventory.✅
3. Real-Time Resource Flow o Implement resource movement using the actual visual assets.✅
o Resources move along conveyors from Point A to Point B.✅
4. Transformation Machine (Basic) o Use real transformation machine model. o Convert resources (e.g., IRON → IRON BAR) and continue the flow.✅
5. Time-Based Failure Condition o Lose condition only if the time runs out before delivering required items.✅
6. Basic UI o Play/Pause/Reset buttons.✅
o Display level number, timer, remaining conveyors.✅
7. Test Level o Build 1 prototype level using real assets to validate core mechanics.❌



✅ Milestone 2: Core Gameplay Systems
Duration: 2–3 Weeks
Cost: $200
🎯 Goals:
1. Multi-Step Transformation o Extend transformation flow (e.g., IRON → IRON BAR → FINAL PRODUCT). o Add more transformation machines.
2. Resource Management
o Configure production rates, resource limits.
o Destroy/loss condition if items don't reach the target in time.
3. Game Objectives & Logic o Add specific delivery goals per level (e.g., deliver 10 Iron Bars).
o Track success/failure based on real-time delivery and time.
4. Level Design o Manually design 5–10 progressively difficult levels.
o Introduce obstacles, limited conveyor count, and new mechanics.
5. Save/Load System o Save player progress, stars earned (if implemented).
o Load saved progress at startup.
6. (Optional) Star Rating System o Rate level performance (1–3 stars) based on time and accuracy. o Display results at level completion.



✅ Milestone 3: Polish & UX Enhancements
Duration: 1 Week
Cost: $50
🎯 Goals:
1. Animations o Conveyor movement, machine operations, transformation visuals.
o Smooth, appealing animations with mobile optimization.
2. UI Enhancements
o Improve the clarity and aesthetics of all buttons, HUD, and level display.
o Optimize touch responsiveness and layout for mobile.
3. Sound & Music o Add appropriate SFX for conveyor motion, transformations, and UI.
o Integrate light industrial background music.
4. Mobile UX Tuning o Refine touch drag/drop mechanics. o Improve gestures and responsiveness for smaller screens.



✅ Milestone 4: Finalization & Release Prep
Duration: 1 Week
Cost: $60
🎯 Goals:
1. Interactive Tutorial o Teach players how to place conveyors, rotate, and complete transformations step-by-step.
2. Final Level Polish o Refine and finalize all levels (15–20 total).
o Add challenging layouts and last-stage mechanics.
3. Optimization o Memory and performance tuning.
o Ensure smooth performance on target devices.
4. QA & Bug Fixing
o Full testing cycle: fix logical, visual, and control-related issues.
o Validate save/load system works on all levels.
5. App Store Submission o Prepare store materials (icon, screenshots, metadata). o Submit the build for review on App Store & Google Play.
